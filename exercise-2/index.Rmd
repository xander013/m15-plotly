## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(plotly)

data <- mtcars[which(mtcars$am == 1 & mtcars$gear == 4),]

p <- plot_ly(data, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',
             marker = list(size = 10)) %>%
  add_annotations(x = data$wt,
                  y = data$mpg,
                  text = rownames(data),
                  xref = "x",
                  yref = "y",
                  showarrow = TRUE,
                  arrowhead = 4,
                  arrowsize = 0.10000,
                  ax = 20,
                  ay = -40)

# Create a shareable link to your chart
# Set up API credentials: https://plot.ly/r/getting-started

p
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
